	description "Shortly after development of the Starling, Remnant ship crafters attempted to apply the design principles they learned towards a medium warship. The Magpie was one functional result of this endeavor."
	description "	There was an unforeseen problem with trying to apply the alien cloaking technology they had access to with a bigger ship: a noticeable increase in consumption of energy and fuel. Until the shipyards solve this problem, larger ships with cloaking will remain a rare sight in Remnant fleets."

	description "The Avialae is an early example of Remnant ship development. Its design function still has traces of principles from ancestral human space. As they acclimated to life in the Ember Wastes the Prefects determined that mass production of big Utility ships was a waste of resources. Instead they chose to focus filling their fleets smaller, more specialized, models."

	description "The Garbage Scow is an ancient ship: developed hundreds of years ago to transport radioactive materials across human space, it had lost importance with the introduction of generalised and better armed haulers like the Bulk Freighter and the Behemoth. Some still operate legitimately, carrying waste away to designated disposal sites. But many of these freighters have wound up in the hands of smugglers after the discovery that the internal structure of their Radiological Containment cylinders are very efficient at hiding cargo from being scanned."
